# Concept of the Project
Wuthering Waves is a Gacha game so, to get characters and combat weapons one has to "pull" for it. These can be predicted to see how many "pulls" are left ti get the character. The odds of getting a five star in a banner is 1 in 90. However, this 5 star is not guaranteed to be the featured 5 star, thus there is another 50/50 chance.  However, if one losses the 50/50 where they dont get the featured character, the next 5 star that they get is guaranteed to be a featured 5 star. 

So the aim of this project is for a way for players to visualise the "pull" data that thye have accumulated though out their play through and help them decide if they should proceed with getting a character. 

## Design
The project is more of a web-scrapper that takes data from a website that the WuWa app uses to visualise "pull" history.
